# numbers are called ints in python
print(5 + 5)
print(2 - 2)
print(10 * 18)


print(8 / 2)
# will output 4.0 --> this is called a float in python. Using div in Python gives us float
# never divide by zero because it will give error "Division by zero"


# You can use the int() function to turn strings into ints or round a float to a int
# You can also use the round() to round a float to a whole number

print(int(5.2))
print(int(5.9))
print(round(5.6))

# You can change the order of operations in Python as well
age = 34
age += 7
print(age)

# This is the same as writing age = age + 7
