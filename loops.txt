* When you find yourself doing the same thing over and over, you're stuck in a loop. When you find yourself doing the same thing over and over, you're stuck in a loop. When you find yourself-- Wow, sorry about that! Loops let us do the same task multiple times. We have two loops in Python and two ways to stop them or skip steps

* for loop and while loop
* for loop lets us do an actions a # amount of times

for name in ["Bob" , "Emily" , "X"]:
    print("Hello " + name)

Hello Bob
Hello Emily
Hello X

* while loops run until the condition is falsey

countdown = 3

while countdown:
    print(countdown)
    countdown -= 1
    print("Happy New Year!")

Happy New Year!

>>> my_list = ['hello', 'how', 'are', 'you']
>>> for word in my_list:
...     print(word)
...
hello
how
are
you

* You can loop things that are iterable or holds more than 1 item in it. Two examples of this would be strings and lists

* using break in the loop allows us to stop the loop early.

>>> names = ['Kenneth', 'Amy', 'Andrew', 'QUIT', 'Lacey']
>>> for name in names:
...     if name == 'QUIT':
...             break
...     print(name)
...
Kenneth

* To skip the item in the list you can use another keyword in Python
---
>>> names = ['Kenneth', 'Amy', 'Andrew', 'QUIT', 'Lacey']
>>> for name in names:
...     if name == 'QUIT':
...             continue
...     print(name)
