* We use the input() function to get information from a user.

input("WHAT is your favorite color? ") takes an optional prompt to use when you need to ask the user a particular question. Python doesn't add any space at the end of the prompt, though, so remember to do that yourself.

The value that comes in from input() is always a string, so if you need a number or something else, you'll need to convert it afterward.

* Input always gives back a string
---
>>> input("Whats your age?")
Whats your age?34
'34'
---
>>> age = input("Whats your age? ")
Whats your age? 34
>>> age
'34'

* To make that a number do it like this
>>> age = int(input("What's your age? "))
What's your age? 32
>>> age + 1
33
